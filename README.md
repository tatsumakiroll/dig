# This is a UI exercise for a mobile vinyl marketplace

Mobile app constructed with Typescript, React Native and Expo Go

The aim was to make a nice set of cards containing the info for a main page in a list format and then have a more detailed single item page for the full listing.

In the future I plan on creating a back end using a relational database to store the listings.
